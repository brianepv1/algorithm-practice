# Modified Binary Search

The Modified Binary Search pattern adapts binary search to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding elements in rotated sorted arrays.

Use this pattern for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays where you need to find a specific element.

## Sample Problem

- Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #33)
- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #153)
- Search a 2D Matrix II (LeetCode #240)
