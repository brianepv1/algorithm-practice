### **Interviewer:**

Alright, let's move on to the next problem. This one is another classic and a great way to practice the frequency counting pattern we've been discussing.

**Challenge #3: Valid Anagram**

**Difficulty:** Easy

Your task is to write a function `isAnagram(s, t)` that takes two strings, `s` and `t`, as input. The function should return `true` if string `t` is an anagram of string `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For this problem, assume the strings only contain lowercase English letters.

**Example 1:**
*   Input: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"`
*   Expected Output: `true`

**Example 2:**
*   Input: `s = "rat"`, `t = "car"`
*   Expected Output: `false`

**Example 3:**
*   Input: `s = "listen"`, `t = "silent"`
*   Expected Output: `true`

Before writing any code, please lay out your step-by-step plan. How would you determine if two strings are anagrams of each other using a hash map?

### **Solution**

- Function is anagram 
    - Parameter 1 as string
    - Parameter 2 as string
    - Return boolean { true or false }


For this case we are expecting only lowecase English but in some problems you need to check if the input have upper cases, so in that case will be case sensitive, and for sure check if there is not empty inputs just to be sure

So for the solution i'm thinking that we can use something similar to the ransomNotes solutions which we basically check for all the letter, save that into a hash map with the number of letters and then starting other check to see if the word can be created 

More deeply we are going to run a for to save all the letter first and it will be something like that

Input 1 = anagram
Input 2 = nagaram

so we are going to check first for the first input which is the word that we are looking to create 

so the result will be something like this 
```
{
    "a": 3, 
    "n": 1:,
    "g": 1,
    "r": 1,
    "m": 1
}
```

So that will be the result for the first hash map which require the first input or word

then we are going to do something similar with the second word but instead of saving the results we are going to check with a conditon if the letter exist on the first hash map

and we are going to say if char which mean for the letter in the second word, if char exist on firstWord which firstWord have all the letter for the input 1 and also we need to check if the char is greater than 0

so the final condition would be if char exist on firstWord and char greater than 0 then continue and rest 1 to the number or to the value of that key  so

we are going to reduce the number in the firstWord hash map and we continue with the traverse of the second word

if the char doest not exist it means that we are not able to create the word because that letter doest not exist and we need that for the word

so we return false

and if everything continues well then we can return true at the end which mean that the word is able to be created


### **Feedback**

This is an excellent breakdown of your thought process. You've correctly identified that this problem is very similar to "Ransom Note" and that a hash map is the right tool. Your step-by-step logic is clear and well-explained.

You are on the right track, but there is a subtle logical flaw in your plan that we need to address. This is a fantastic learning opportunity because it highlights the key difference between an anagram and the ransom note problem.

### Feedback on Your Plan

**What You Did Well:**

*   **Pattern Recognition:** You correctly recognized this is a frequency counting problem and immediately thought of using a hash map. This is the most important skill, and you've nailed it.
*   **Logical Steps:** Your plan to (1) count the characters of the first string and then (2) check/decrement using the second string is a solid foundation.
*   **Considering Edge Cases:** You correctly mentioned thinking about case sensitivity and empty inputs. That's a sign of a thorough developer.

### The Crucial Difference for Anagrams

Let's look at the definition again: An anagram uses **all the original letters exactly once**. This means the character counts must be **identical**.

Now, let's test your proposed algorithm with a tricky case:

*   Input 1: `s = "aab"`
*   Input 2: `t = "ab"`

Let's follow your steps:
1.  You build the hash map from `s`: `counts = { a: 2, b: 1 }`. Correct.
2.  You start iterating through `t = "ab"`:
    *   First character is `'a'`. Does it exist in `counts` and is the count > 0? Yes (it's 2). So you decrement it. The map is now `{ a: 1, b: 1 }`.
    *   Second character is `'b'`. Does it exist in `counts` and is the count > 0? Yes (it's 1). So you decrement it. The map is now `{ a: 1, b: 0 }`.
3.  You reach the end of the loop for `t`.
4.  Your plan says: "if everything continues well then we can return true".

According to your plan, the function would return `true`. But is `"ab"` an anagram of `"aab"`? **No.** The original string `s` had an extra `'a'` that wasn't used.

**Your current algorithm correctly checks if `t` can be constructed from `s`, but it doesn't check if they are made of the *exact same* character counts.**

### How to Fix the Plan (Two Excellent Options)

Here are two ways to adjust your algorithm to make it perfectly correct for anagrams.

**Option 1: The Pre-check (Most Common & Efficient)**

The simplest observation is this: **If two strings are anagrams, they must have the same length.**

We can use this as a "guard clause" at the very beginning.

**The Refined Algorithm:**
1.  **First, check if `s.length` is equal to `t.length`.** If they are not equal, it's impossible for them to be anagrams. **Return `false` immediately.** This saves you all the other work.
2.  Now, proceed with the rest of your original plan:
    *   Create a hash map of character counts for string `s`.
    *   Loop through string `t`. For each character, decrement the count in the map. If a character is not in the map or its count is already zero, return `false`.
3.  If the second loop finishes without returning `false`, you can now be certain they are anagrams. Why? Because you already confirmed they have the same length, so there can't be any "leftover" characters. You can safely **return `true`**.

This is the standard, most efficient way to solve this problem.

**Option 2: Check for Leftovers at the End**
You could also keep your original plan but add a final check.
1. Create the map from `s`.
2. Decrement using `t`.
3. After the loop for `t` is done, loop through all the **values** in your hash map. If any value is not `0`, it means there was a mismatch. Return `false`.
4. If all values are `0`, return `true`.

This works, but the first option is better because the length check at the beginning can save you a lot of time.

### Summary

Your thinking is sharp. You identified the right pattern. The key takeaway is to always double-check your logic against the precise definition of the problem. For anagrams, that definition is "exact same character counts," which implies "exact same length."

With the length pre-check in mind, please go ahead and write the code. You're very close
