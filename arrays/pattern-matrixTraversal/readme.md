# Matrix Traversal

Matrix Traversal involves traversing elements in a matrix using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

Use this pattern for problems involving traversing 2D grids or matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## Sample Problem

- Flood Fill (LeetCode #733)
- Number of Islands (LeetCode #200)
- Surrounded Regions (LeetCode #130)
