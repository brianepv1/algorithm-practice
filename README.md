# 🚀 Algorithm Practice Repository (Kind of)

Welcome to my Algorithm Practice Repository! 👋

Aspiring to join a FAANG company? 🌟 Sharpening your coding skills daily is the key, and this repository is where the magic happens (Not sure if magic but we are trying for sure). Here, you'll find a record of my (not) daily algorithm practice journey as I work towards becoming a top-notch software developer. 🖥️

## 📖 About This Repository

In this repository, you will discover:

- 🧠 (not) Daily Algorithm Challenges: I'll be solving a variety of algorithm problems from different sources, including LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal, Some AIs like Gemini or ChatGTP.
- 📈 Progress Tracking: I'll keep track of my daily practice sessions, code solutions, and improvement over time (Readme is a track tool? I think so).
- 💡 Problem Descriptions: Clear explanations (Maybe) and problem statements for each algorithm challenge I tackle.


## 🌟 Why Algorithm Practice?

Practicing algorithms daily has several benefits:

- 💪 Strengthens Problem-Solving Skills
- 🧐 Enhances Coding Proficiency
- 🏆 Builds Confidence for Technical Interviews

## 🗓️ Daily Commitment

I'm committed to practicing algorithms every day (Not true at all but hey lets keep the feeling), rain or shine (Lier!, I'll probably will be with a coffee and some manga, book or a movie with rainy weather). 🌧️☀️ I believe that consistent effort is the path to success, and I invite you to join me on this journey (That's true, the discipline will get you whatever your goal is, but the journey is no always happy). Feel free to contribute, offer feedback, or simply follow along to see my progress! 

## 🤝 Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, whether it's suggesting new problems, improving existing solutions, or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your support means the world to me! 🙌

(If you have real problems or something that you want to add please open a PR, if you can't open PRs let me know, I'm not a master of github repos)


## 📢 Let's Connect
