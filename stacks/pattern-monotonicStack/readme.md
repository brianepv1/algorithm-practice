# Monotonic Stack

The Monotonic Stack pattern uses a stack to maintain a sequence of elements in a specific order (increasing or decreasing).

Use this pattern for problems that require finding the next greater or smaller element.

## Sample problem:

- Next Greater Element I (LeetCode #496)
- Daily Temperatures (LeetCode #739)
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram (LeetCode #84)
