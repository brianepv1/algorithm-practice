# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

## Sample Problem:

- Maximum Average Subarray I (LeetCode #643)
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode #3)
- Minimum Window Substring (LeetCode #76)
