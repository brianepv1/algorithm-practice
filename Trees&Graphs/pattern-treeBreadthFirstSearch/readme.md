# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal technique that explores nodes level by level in a tree or graph.

Use this pattern for finding the shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversal in trees.


## Sample Problem

- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (LeetCode #102)
- Rotting Oranges (LeetCode #994)
- Word Ladder (LeetCode #127)
